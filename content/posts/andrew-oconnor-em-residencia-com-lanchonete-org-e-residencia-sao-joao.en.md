Andrew is an independent radio producer and sound artist based in Toronto Canada. His work reflects an interest in sound, storytelling, and transmission, and explores these ideas through formal broadcast radio as well as installation art, sound design, and pirate radio. Andrew’s work for the radio has been featured across the CBC Radio network, syndicated internationally on Australian public radio ABC, Radio Zero in Lisbon, and by Austrian public broadcaster ORF. Most recently his work has been featured in the Radiophrenia Festival put on by the Glasgow Centre for Contemporary Art, and at the Deep Wireless festival of Radio Art. Andrew currently hosts and produces a weekly pirate radio show called DISCO 3000 on his very own low watt FM station Parkdale Pirate Radio.

  

While in São Paulo, Andrew will be exploring the Paim neighborhood at Conjunto Santos Dumont, and documenting the sounds and people to create a new work.

  

_Working together with [São João Residency](https://www.residenciasaojoao.com/) in Rio State, Lanchonete.org gets to experiment with co-hosting an artist across rural and urban contexts. Andrew will be at São João for a few weeks before coming to São Paulo. Similar to [Anat Litwin's research residency](http://lanchonete.org/2019/05/anat-litwin-participa-de-seminario-internacional-da-escola-da-cidade/) on artistic hosting earlier this year during Escola da Cidade's International Seminar, we will 'open the door' with a series of introductions at Conjunto Santos Dumont on Rua Paim. From the first set of introductions Andrew is invited to build a programme of activities or encounters for the duration of his stay, culminating in a radio show at the lunch counter. Working together with Sao Joao Residency, we are looking for new models of hosting across different experiences. Andrew is welcome to pick that up in his investigation, but it is not required. Should Andrew want to build a radio intervention with us at Lanchonete.org for the future, such a proposal would normally come up during the 'action' research residency._
