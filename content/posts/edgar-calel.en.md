_Edgar Calel was born_ in 1987 in San Juan Comalapa, Guatemala, where he lives and works. His artistic work is a continuous search for the translation of the Maya-Kaqchiquel (culture to which he belongs) cosmovision into other contemporary languages. He works mainly with themes related to his community's indigenous practices, Maya spirituality, rituals, identity, and migration.
