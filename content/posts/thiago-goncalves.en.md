Thiago Correia Gonçalves is a Brazilian artist and architect currently based in Brooklyn, NY. He studied Cinema at FAAP and Architecture at AEAUSP-Escola da Cidade, both in São Paulo, and at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London.

His oeuvre faces visible and invisible relationships existing in the vertigo of colonization, particularly in the context of South America and the Africa Diaspora. With various procedures and techniques, the centrality of his investigations often arise from the influence received from anthropological topics and the urban environment and how they relates to the food system.

By making use of objects, actions and situations that are characteristic of the language of urban daily life and through performances that promote public interaction and sensuous experiences, he discusses power relations and imposition. His practice transforms into many different forms and crosses the borders of politics, personal experiences, environmentalism, urbanism and food.
