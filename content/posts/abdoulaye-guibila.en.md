Abdoulaye is 28 years old and from Burkina Faso. He arrived in Brazil with the dream of working and learning more about cooking and culinary techniques. He initially worked in construction sites in order to sustain himself, until he was able to do the job that he truly likes, to cook. He got to know Gastromotiva, where he learned kitchen techniques and, at the same time, the Brazilian culinary system. He was winner of the dessert competition KENZO DO BEM, evaluated by Brasil Fogaça’s Master Chef. It was a huge experience for him, and he began to think of taking Gastromotiva to Burkina Faso. He joined the group Lanchonete.org, where he carried out several events with the collective, and put to practice much of what he had learned during his time at Gastromotiva.
