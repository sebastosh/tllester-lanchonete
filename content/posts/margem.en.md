Margem is a multidisciplinary architecture technical consulting group. It has worked for six years understanding the concept of habitat as a common good and a right to all. It addresses precarious conditions of extreme urban social inequalities in the self-produced city, and the serious problems of insalubrity and spatial quality, as well as property conflicts, especially urban, and the recognition of community territory, defending the compliance of the constitutional rights to housing and the city. It is of consensus in the group, which acts in São Paulo, Brazil, and in Padova, Italy, the importance and value of multidisciplinarity in all of its proposed actions.
