**While some of these projects are still taking shape, here are some examples:**

\-       Artist residencies that enable international artists to be a part of public events and those convened by KUIR City, e.g. Mix Brasil Festival—Carlos Motta (Colombia), Maya Mikdashi (Lebanon), Niki Singleton (Canada), Thea Little (US)—and _In Between_, a conference on public policies for transitory spaces for which Jean-Francois Prost (Canada) was a speaker within a broader three-week research residency in the Center of São Paulo;

\-       Artist residencies that allow intimate dialogues between local artists and their international colleagues, such as the EXPLODE Think Tank that will happen in the East Periphery of São Paulo in late August with artists João Marcelo and Claudio Bueno and members of UltraRed (Michael Roberson and Robert Sember) and guests to look deeper at the intersectional relations between race, class, and KUIRness from the childhood home of artist, Claudio Bueno and connecting the sound/musical cultures work of the two collectives;

\-       A Lambe Lambe (poster) workshop in the North Periphery on May 14/15 that will serve as a prototype for a second one in September in relation to a culminating ‘Human Rights Ball’ that will be held in partnership with the Secretary of Human Rights engaging both EXPLODE and UltraRed, etc;

\-       A year-long ‘KUIR Graphics Laboratory’ with .Aurora;

\-       Support to individual projects by local curators and artists, e.g. Thiago de Paulo Souza (Lambe Lambe workshop and ‘#What Body is it?’) , João Bertholini (trans portraiture), Aretha Sadick (‘Entre X e Y’ / migrating genders), Mavi Veloso, etc;

\-       A collaboration with the other of [Lanchonete.org](http://lanchonete.org/)’s two main initiatives, Zona da Mata, which focuses on permaculture; KUIR City will work with MEXA (an LGBT homeless collective) in the city’s most intense drug usage area, Crackolandia;

\-       Members of [Lanchonete.org](http://lanchonete.org/) presenting the work externally, e.g. Raphael Daibert at Free Home University (Lecce, Italy – 2015 & 2016);

\-       Engagement of public events such as Virada Cultural and Mix Brasil Festival

\-       Scholarships for participants to attend related events in other parts of Brasil
