Led by Joseph Michael Patricio, Nowhere Kitchen is a research process that derives ways of learning (by doing) from cooking practices. It explores various social forms based on cooking with _what is there_ as a ritualistic point of departure. By itself, it is liquid and can assume the form of and intervene with the contexts it inhabits.  During his March 2015 residency with Lanchonete.org, Joseph (a.k.a. Pepe Dayaw) conjured Nowhere Kitchen in two cultural spaces in the Center of São Paulo—Phosphorus and the São João Cultural Center.
