[:en\]Cities Without Hunger is a non-governmental organization (NGO) which has set up sustainable agrarian projects based on organ- ic farming in São Paulo. The aim is to help and teach people to manage their own business and become financially independent, as well as to improve the diets of adults and children. Additionally, the Small Family Farms Project has been set up in Rio Grande do Sul to train farmers in multiple cropping as an alternative to monoculture and help them starting new businesses in organic farming.
