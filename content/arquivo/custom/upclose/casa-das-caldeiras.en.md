Casa das Caldeiras, a former industrial building listed as heritage since 1986, opens its doors on Sunday afternoons with the project TODODOMINGO, offering music shows, performances, exhibitions, workshops, lectures, cultural and artistic activities to the general public. The place also works as headquarters of a cultural association involved in promoting its occupation, as well as the mobilization of artistic, cultural, and social energies.
