Additionally, the space also has a library, courtyard and a playroom for children. A partnership between Lanchonete.org and Occupation São João began with a three-week residency for Polish architect Jakub Szczęsny. During his residency, a multi-year collaboration was planned. Jakub’s drawings hint at the brainstorming that filled those three weeks in March 2014 (See: projects within the project).
