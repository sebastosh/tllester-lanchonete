[:en\]Joseph Michael Patricio is Pepe Dayaw. 'Pepe Dayaw' is a work-in-progress. In this work lies a blend of folklore, precarious technologies and funky improvisations whose mission is to research and choreograph living designs and sociality. Formally educated in the University of the Philippines, University of Amsterdam, University of Warwick, the National Museum of Reina Sofia Madrid and the Kaloob Philippine Music and Dance Ministry, Pepe performs, having trained in several dance disciplines such as pangalay and butoh, a self-taught chef, polyglot and masseur; and a professional karaoke singer. Born in Manila and grew up everywhere, Pepe is a leftover of past lives that get renewed each time he performs. He started cooking out of nostalgia for island tropical memories and has since been utilising this practice as a research tool for rehearsing emergent democracies through his independent production platform [Nowhere Kitchen](http://www.nowherekitchen.com).
