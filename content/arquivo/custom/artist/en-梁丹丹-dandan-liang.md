[:en\]梁丹丹 (Dandan Liang) is a theatre producer, manager, performer and director from Beijing. In 2008, she co-founded and began operating the very first independent theater in China – Beijing Penghao Theater. It is still the only theatre in Beijing to present a wide variety of performances. Since it’s founding, the 110 person black-box theater in Beijing has hosted over 200 different performances from artists around China and the world. By acting as a public Chinese theatre it has become an essential cultural force: cultivating original pieces, hosting international festivals and setting the stage for a theater community and dialogue in Beijing that previously did not exist. In 2014, Dandan enrolled in the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts to learn how theater organizations around the world operate.
