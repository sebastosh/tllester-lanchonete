\[:en\]Maya Mikdashi is a Mellon Postdoc at the Institute for Research on Women and the Department of Women and Gender Studies at Rutgers University. Her upcoming book length manuscript entitled " Sex and Sectarianism: Secularism, Secularity and War in Contemporary Lebanon," is both an archival and ethnographic study of the regulation of sexual and religious difference within secular political systems. Maya works at the intersection of legal anthropology, feminism, queer theory, and theories of sovereignty, secularism and religion. She has worked on a number of documentary and narrative film projects, and continues to edit and write for Jadaliyya, an e-zine that she co-founded and that is centered on critical approaches to studying the transnational Middle East.\[:\]
