[Ghawazee](https://vimeo.com/ghawazeecoletivo) is a transdisciplinary performance action collective, made up of women with different artistic backgrounds, which investigates the expressions of the feminine through artistic actions presented in public spaces. The collective is searching for the creation of an experimental language practice that forges a temporary, transgressive disruptions in the order of everyday life through artistic actions, intended mostly for the local, found and unforeseen public.
