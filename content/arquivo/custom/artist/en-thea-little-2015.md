[:en\]Thea Little is a choreographer, performer, musician, and composer born and living in New York City, USA. She holds an MFA in Dance from Hollins University and a BA in Dance from the School of General Studies at Columbia University. Thea works collaboratively with trained dancers, non-dancers, and performance artists, as well as with artists in other mediums, and draws a lot of her material from improvisation, with performances ranging from loose to set structures depending on venues and concepts. Thea is primarily interested in issues of boundaries, stretching what is foreign to home,  and what is rigid and controlling to accepting and nurturing.[:]
