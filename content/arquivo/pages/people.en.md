#### **Queer City** (2016, 2017)

Todd Lester, Raphael Daibert, Pato Hebert, Edições Aurora, Coletivo Amem, and EXPLODE! (Outbound: Quito, 2017) (Outbound: NYC, 2017) Queerness is a broad term, one that can certainly be linked to a range of LGBT+ politics and realities, as well as histories, futures and places. For our purposes, Queer City opens a discussion on how we live and work in, share and survive the contemporary city, with São Paulo as our outlook. We are therefore equally interested in acknowledging common ground and understanding counter narratives. During the program, there were thematic [Jantas](http://www.cidadequeer.lanchonete.org/projetos-projects/janta/) at the actor Paulo Goya's [Casarão do Belvedere](https://www.facebook.com/casaraodobelvedere/). During the festa julina event, the [Transarau](http://www.cidadequeer.lanchonete.org/2016/06/27/janta-5-transarau-julino-queerdrilha/), in partnership with Cursinho Popular Transformação, Jup do Bairro and Linn da Quebrada were headliners with a performance that took place in front of the house.

#### **Irene Small**

Small designed an advanced course for Princeton's Art & Archaeology Department entitled ART456 Contemporary Art: The World Picture (2016).

In 1989, an exhibition titled Magiciens de la Terre (Magicians of the Earth) opened at the Centre Georges Pompidou and the Grande Halle de la Villette in Paris, signaling a sea change in international contemporary art. While prior exhibitions of contemporary art at such scale had focused primarily on art produced in Western Europe and the United States, relegating aesthetic production from much of the rest of the world to minor roles designated “national,” “ethnic,” or “vernacular,” curator Jean-Hubert Martin made the polemical decision to present fifty Western artists alongside fifty non-Western artists, mixing avant-garde, traditional, quotidian, and ritualistic practices at will. All the participants, Martin ventured, were “magicians” of the world, and their artworks were “containers of metaphysical values.” In an interview he stated that the show was nothing less than “the first truly international exhibition of contemporary art.” While Magiciens de la Terre was heavily criticized (for its exoticism, spectacular character, and deliberate decontextualization, for example), it nevertheless marked a new era of mobilizing large-scale art exhibitions as a means to question, bridge, and transform cultural divisions across the world. Almost thirty years later, with the international mega-exhibition and its accompanying critical discourses a fixture within the art circuit, we can recognize how strikingly Magiciens de la Terre marked the “global turn” in contemporary art.

A key component of the course was a field trip over fall recess to visit the 32nd São Paulo Bienal. Similar a visit by the Van Alen Institute in 2017, Lanchonete.org was invited to be the group's guide for the first day of their short trip.

Zona da Mata was a three-way partnership between [artist Rodrigo Bueno](http://artist Rodrigo Bueno) (its author), the Goethe Institute and Lanchonete.org (its producer).

#### **Pepe Dayaw**

Joseph Michael Patricio is Pepe Dayaw. ‘Pepe Dayaw’ is a work-in-progress.

Born in Manila and grew up everywhere, Pepe is a leftover of past lives that get renewed each time he performs. He started cooking out of nostalgia for island tropical memories and has since been utilising this practice as a research tool for rehearsing emergent democracies through his independent production platform Nowhere Kitchen.

Pepe Dayaw visited Lanchonete.org twice. On his second visit he offered one of the five artist-prepared banquets in support of [FICA / Fundo Imobiliário Comunitário para Aluguel](https://fundofica.org/); spoke to a class at FAU-USP; created a sound and food performance at Casa Tofiq; and lived at the Occupation Sao Joao where he was the featured guest at their monthly Cafe Imaginario.
